## Qwen Added Memories
- Project: Bhaktinandan OMS - A textile/weaving business management system built with Next.js 14+, TypeScript, Supabase, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui. It manages inventory, ledgers, production (weaver challans), purchase orders, and user roles (Admin, Manager, User).
- Authentication: The system uses Supabase Auth with email/password authentication. Users must select their role (Admin/Manager/User) during login. Role-based access control is implemented with protected routes and database row-level security policies.
- Database Structure: Core tables include profiles (user profiles), products (inventory), ledgers (business partners), purchase_orders, weaver_challans (production), expenses, and logs for changes. All tables have Row Level Security (RLS) policies based on user roles.
- Key Modules: 1) Inventory Management - Product creation with images, categories, SKUs; 2) Ledger Management - Business partner records with GST details; 3) Production Management - Weaver challans with batch numbers, quality details, taka tracking; 4) Purchase Management - Purchase orders with supplier integration and itemized billing; 5) User Management - Role-based user creation and profile management (Admin only).
- Technology Stack: Frontend - Next.js 14+ with App Router, React 18, TypeScript; Styling - Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, Radix UI; Backend - Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Realtime); State Management - Zustand; Forms - React Hook Form + Zod; Data Fetching - TanStack Query; Charts - Recharts; Tables - TanStack Table.
- Development Status: The project is 95% complete and ready for production deployment. All core features are implemented including authentication, database schema with RLS, all major modules (Inventory, Ledger, Production, Purchase, Users), real-time dashboard with live data, and responsive UI. Next steps are data migration from the old PHP system and production deployment.
