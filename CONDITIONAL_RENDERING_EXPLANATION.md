# Batch History Feature - Conditional Rendering Explanation

## Overview
The enhanced batch history feature implements conditional rendering for different sections based on the availability of data. This ensures that users only see relevant information and aren't confused by empty sections.

## Conditional Rendering Logic

### Basic Summary Cards (Always Shown)
These cards are displayed for all batches:
- Weaver Challan
- Total Shorting
- Remaining Quantity
- Total Stitching
- Total Expenses

### Enhanced Stitching Statistics Cards (Conditional)
These additional cards only appear when there are stitching challans associated with the batch:
- Total Top Quantity
- Total Bottom Quantity
- Average per Challan
- Utilization Rate

## Why Your Batch Doesn't Show Enhanced Cards

For batch BN20250813001, the system shows:
- Total Stitching: 0 pcs, 0 challans

Since there are no stitching challans (0 challans), the enhanced stitching statistics cards are not displayed. This is the intended behavior to avoid showing empty or meaningless information.

## How to See All Enhanced Features

To see all the enhanced features, you need a batch that has:
1. At least one stitching challan
2. Stitching challans with top/bottom quantity data

### Example Scenario
If a batch had:
- 1 or more stitching challans
- Stitching challans with populated `top_qty`, `bottom_qty`, etc. fields

Then you would see:
- All basic summary cards
- Additional stitching statistics cards:
  - Total Top Quantity (meters and pieces)
  - Total Bottom Quantity (meters and pieces)
  - Average quantity per challan
  - Utilization rate (efficiency metric)
- Enhanced stitching challans table with detailed breakdown

## Technical Implementation

In the `batch-history.tsx` component, the conditional rendering is implemented as:

```jsx
{/* Additional Stitching Statistics */}
{history.isteaching_challans && history.isteaching_challans.length > 0 && (
  <div className="grid grid-cols-1 md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4 gap-4 mb-8">
    {/* Enhanced cards here */}
  </div>
)}
```

This ensures that the enhanced cards only render when there are actual stitching challans to display data for.

## Verification

To verify that the feature is working correctly:
1. Check a batch with no stitching challans → Should only see basic cards
2. Check a batch with stitching challans → Should see all cards including enhanced statistics

This conditional rendering approach provides a clean, informative user interface that adapts to the available data.
